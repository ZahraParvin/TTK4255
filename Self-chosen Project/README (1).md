Matrix-free transformations using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)



## Feedback
Good work. It is not easy for students to learn an entirely new area of math. You have demonstrated a basic understanding of Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). However, you use some unconventional notation. I believe you think the wedge product in LaTeX is represented by '^', but it should actually be '\wedge'.
