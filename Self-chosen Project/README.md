This project outlines a project on matrix-free transformations using Projective Geometric Algebra
(PGA) within the context of robotic vision and delves into PGA as a unifying framework for
geometrical computation, enabling simplification of computational difficulties in domains where
calculations depend heavily on geometrical properties. It particularly emphasizes the practicality
of PGA in performing operations such as rotations, translations, and manipulations of geometric
entities without the need for coordinate matrices. It also covers the theoretical foundations of PGA,
describes the algebraic representation of geometric entities, and discusses various PGA operations,
including rotors, translators, and motors. It also details an experiment involving a Python program
designed to rotate and translate an image using PGA, discussing the results and the advantages
of PGA over traditional methods.




## Feedback
Good work. It is not easy for students to learn an entirely new area of math. You have demonstrated a basic understanding of Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). However, you use some unconventional notation. I believe you think the wedge product in LaTeX is represented by '^', but it should actually be '\wedge'.
