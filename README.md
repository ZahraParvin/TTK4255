Project and homeworks Spring 2024

## Course Content

This course focuses on visual perception and image processing, covering key mathematical tools and operations such as matrices, linear/non-linear transformations, and frequency analysis, image formation, camera models, and geometry for single and multiple views. The course also includes feature extraction, pose estimation, and motion analysis.

Also, it explores Localization and Mapping with SLAM, covering both indirect (feature-based) and direct methods, as well as sensor combinations like IMU and RGB-Depth. Finally, it discusses briefly object detection, recognition, and scene understanding, providing a comprehensive approach to visual systems.
